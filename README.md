# Donuts Lea Verou SVG style!

## With React!

Inspired by Lea Verou Talk [Youtube link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVnUDTtOLE0) about pies, and slices and toppings and jams ... what was I talking about? Oh yeah, right!

So - Lea showed a sweet way to implement pie chart via SVG. I needed a dynamic pie chart for my current project - so I toyed with this implementation.

For now it's work in progress, probably would stay that way, but still) 

Would only work with webpack - since it loads external css - in time - gonna write all the styles inline, probably
